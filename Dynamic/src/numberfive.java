	The rod-decomposition problem: You have a company that sells rods of different integer
	lengths. Each length s has a price p_s that you can sell it at. Given a rod of total
	length n, find the best way to cut it into pieces so that you can maximize the total
	amount that the pieces sell for. (The goal is $O(n^2)$ time.)
